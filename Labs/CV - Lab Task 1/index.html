        <h2>Profile</h2>
        <p>
        I am a Computer Science student with a growing interest in Software Quality Assurance (SQA), DevOps, and system engineering. Alongside my studies, I have gained hands-on experience in building basic DevOps pipelines using Git, Jenkins, Docker, and deployment platforms. I enjoy working on projects that combine learning with practical implementation, such as setting up CI/CD workflows and managing deployments in containers. I am continuously learning and expanding my skills in Java, HTML/CSS, and cloud tools while also focusing on problem-solving and algorithm analysis. My academic projects, including a Vehicle Management System and an AI Fitness Trainer, have allowed me to explore software engineering concepts like requirement analysis, UML design, and performance tracking. I aim to start my career in Software Quality Assurance or DevOps, contributing to projects where I can apply my technical foundation, attention to detail, and eagerness to grow as a professional.
